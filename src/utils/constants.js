export const ABOUT_MD = `Back in 2020, I decided to try my hand at creating [Rainmeter](https://rainmeter.net) themes and went down the rabbit hole of coding and front-end development. Fast-forward to today, I'm now pursuing my degree in **Computer Science at The University of Hong Kong**. 


My main focus these days is to design and practice building user interfaces and web-apps, apart from my studies. I most enjoy building software that revolves around the user experience, built and designed with the users in mind. I also work on [LaTeX uni course notes](https://jaxtam.dev/notes), which aims to organize materials in a stripped-down yet cohesive way. 


When I'm not at the computer, I'm usually at the gym, photographing, hanging out with my girlfriend and two dogs, or eating Sam Gor mixian.
